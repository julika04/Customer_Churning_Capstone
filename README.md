# Customer_Churning_Capstone
# Problem Statement

An E Commerce company or DTH provider is facing a lot of competition in the current market and it has become a challenge to retain the existing customers in the current situation. Hence, the company wants to develop a model through which they can do churn prediction of the accounts and provide segmented offers to the potential churners. In this company, account churn is a major thing because 1 account can have multiple customers. hence by losing one account the company might be losing more than one customer.

# Need of the project

A predictive model is needed which estimates at the level of individual whether they will leave. Technically it is a classification model which divide into two groups, churn or not churn. By knowing which group of customers are leaving, it will be easy to the company to set efforts to retain them. The main need of project is the supervised data having a responsive target. Based on the training data, the model learns to best capture the relationship between features and target. Basically, it needs historical data where a customer already left and not left. And the data should have demographic information, transaction information, interaction between company and customer information, revenue, span of a customer in service etc.

# Understanding Business/Social oppertunity

We are assigned to develop a churn prediction model for this company and provide business recommendations on the campaign. The campaign suggestion should be unique and be very clear on the campaign offer because our recommendation will go through the revenue assurance team. Company is highly dependent on data, which underscores the importance of collecting it. Accurate data collection is necessary to make informed business decisions, ensure quality assurance, and keep research integrity. The churn prediction gives opportunity to company understand more about their service or product quality to improve so that they can attract more customers. It also tells how high the risk is of losing them. E-commerce businesses try to keep the churn rate at a minimum as it is significantly easier, and less costly, to retain customers, than it is to attract new ones. The study says, monthly churn rate should not cross more than 5%, the smaller the rate the better is for company and every company tries to keep churning rate of 2-3%-5%.
